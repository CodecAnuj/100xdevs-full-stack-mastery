# Week 7.1.0 React Routing 

This project demonstrates client-side routing in React, along with the use of **lazy loading** and the **Suspense API** for asynchronous component fetching.

## What I Learned

### 1. Client-Side Routing

This project uses **React Router** for client-side routing, allowing seamless navigation between pages without a full page reload. It demonstrates how to use `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `useNavigate`.

**Key Concepts:**

- **BrowserRouter**: Wraps the entire app to provide routing context.
- **Routes & Route**: Defines different paths (`/` for Landing page, `/dashboard` for Dashboard).
- **useNavigate**: A hook used to navigate programmatically between routes.

**Example from Code:**

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Routes, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

function Appbar() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => navigate("/")}>Landing Page</button>
      <button onClick={() => navigate("/dashboard")}>Dashboard</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. Lazy Loading

The project implements **lazy loading** using React's `lazy()` function. This helps in dynamically loading components (`Landing` and `Dashboard`) only when they are needed, improving performance.

**Key Concepts:**

- **lazy()**: Dynamically imports the component when itâ€™s needed.

**Example from Code:**

```jsx
const Landing = lazy(() => import("./components/Landing"));
const Dashboard = lazy(() => import("./components/Dashboard"));
```

### 3. Suspense API

The project uses **Suspense** to handle the loading state while the components are being fetched asynchronously. The `fallback` prop is used to display a loading message while the components are being loaded.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Suspense**: Wraps around the component and provides a fallback UI while the component is being loaded.

**Example from Code:**

```jsx
<Suspense fallback={"loading..."}>
  <Landing />
</Suspense>
```

In the project, both the `Landing` and `Dashboard` components are loaded lazily and wrapped inside `Suspense` to handle loading states.

### Additional Notes:

- The `Appbar` component uses the `useNavigate` hook to navigate between routes, showing how navigation works in a multi-component setup.
- The routing paths include:
  - `/` for the **Landing page**
  - `/dashboard` for the **Dashboard**
